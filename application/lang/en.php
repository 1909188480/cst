		If you are using the functions of the ChainStar platform for the first time, please read the following instructions in detail.
	</div>
	<p class="zhuti">What are the steps for launching a project?</p>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp1">Step 1</span>
		<span class="sp2">Basic information: Please fill in your true basic information as required for display, upload your project LOGO and White Paper PDF file.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp1">Step 2</span>
		<span class="sp2">White Paper: Please upload each page of White Paper PDF file in order.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp1">Step 3</span>
		<span class="sp2">Route planning: Upload a roadmap and explain how the route progresses.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp1">Step 4</span>
		<span class="sp2">Team introduction: Fill in the basic information of each member as required. The private information section will not be displayed publicly. It is only used for platform auditing, and it must be consistent with the number of team members in the White Paper.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp1">Step 5</span>
		<span class="sp2">Fund-raising plan: Set the funding time, requirements and lock-in mechanism for the project on the ChainStar platform.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp1">Step 6</span>
		<span class="sp2">To operate in the personal center: After the project is successfully established, you can delete or modify the editing operation in the personal center - My project, and submit the review after confirmation.</span>
	</div>
	<p class="zhuti">How to get the funds raised?</p>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp2">All items on the ChainStar platform are funded in the form of mainstream digital cryptocurrency. Currently, the digital currency fundraising is only available for ETH,currently, and BTC and USDT will be available later</span>
	</div>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp2">After your project is successfully approved, the ChainStar platform will generate a separate cold wallet address for your project, which will be used to temporarily deposit the collected digital currency. The address will be sent to your personal center - message. Please pay attention.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp2">After the fundraising plan is completed, you can initiate the request to withdraw tokens, but before that, you need to transfer the digital cryptocurrency issued by you to the ChainStar platform into your digital cryptocurrency as a guaranteed token, the amount of which is equal to your need of mainstream digital currency. After the currency confirmation is completed, you can withdraw the coins you have raised, and the ChainStar platform will issue your protection tokens to investors according to your lock-in plan.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp2">If you fail to transfer enough protection tokens, you will not be able to withdraw the investment tokens raised by the project.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp2">If the fundraising plan is not completed as scheduled, the ChainStar platform will refund the investment tokens raised by the project to the investor\'s investment wallet address.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="buzhou">
		<span class="sp2">If the fundraising plan is completed successfully, the ChainStar platform will deduct 5% of the funds raised as service fees, and the remaining digital currency will be issued to your collection wallet after you initiate the withdrawal.</span>

	If you are using the functions of the ChainStar platform for the first time, please read the following instructions carefully.
</div>
<div class="chouzi">All projects on the ChainStar platform are funded in the form of mainstream digital cryptographic currency, Currently there are three kinds of digital currency that can be invested:BTC、ETH、USDT，Follow-up will add support for other digital cryptocurrencies。</div>
<p class="zhuti">What are the steps to initiate an investment?</p>
<div class="buzhou">
	<span class="sp1">real name authentication</span>
	<span class="sp2">For security reasons, the ChainStar platform requires investors to real-name authenticate before launching an investment.
	When real-name authentication, you need to submit your coin-purse address. All digital currencies that you invest in ChainStar need to be transferred from this wallet address, and also used to receive the project-side tokens obtained through investment.</span>
</div>
<div class="buzhou">
	<span class="sp1">Browse project information</span>
	<span class="sp2">You need to browse all the information of each project as much as possible as an investment reference, ChainStar platform provides a complete set of project rating system: Star Valu, can also be used as your investment reference.</span>
</div>
<div class="buzhou">
	<span class="sp1">Digital Currency Investment</span>
	<span class="sp2">After confirming all the project information, you can transfer the corresponding digital currency to the project party. The digital currency will not directly enter the wallet address of the project party. The ChainStar platform generates a separate cold wallet address for the project party, all investment will enter the cold wallet address, the ChainStar platform and all users will jointly supervise it. When the funding plan for the project is completed on schedule, the ChainStar platform will send all investors\' digital currency to the project\'s wallet address. At the same time, it will also distribute the digital currency of your due project party to your investment wallet address you submitted.</span>
	<span class="sp2" style="margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:24px;">If the project party has a lock-in plan, the project-side token issued to you will be carried out according to the project\'s lock-in plan.</span>
	<span class="sp2">Within 7 working days after transferring the investment token to the project, you may withdraw your investment in the project at any time. After withdrawal, you cannot initiate investment in the project again; if the project fails to complete the financing plan as scheduled, the digital cryptocurrency you invested in the project will be returned by the ChainStar platform to your investment wallet address.</span>
</div>
<div class="buzhou">
	<span class="sp1">friendly reminder</span>
	<span class="sp2" style="color:#003366;">The Star valu rating system system provided by the ChainStar platform has only investment reference functions and does not constitute investment advice and guidance. All investment behaviors should be based on the investor’s own knowledge, investigation, and understanding of the project.</span>
	<span class="sp2" style="margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:24px;color:#003366;">Any investment is risky. The subsequent loss of value due to fluctuations in market value and unfavorable operating conditions of the digital cryptocurrency issued by the project party has nothing to do with the ChainStar platform.</span>
	<span class="sp2" style="color:#003366;">During the fundraising plan, the investor is unable to obtain immediate rewards. The project will release the reward to the investor after the completion of the fundraising plan; if the project fails to complete the fundraising plan as scheduled, the investor’s investment will be returned. The issue of generating revenue will not be borne by the ChainStar platform.</span>
